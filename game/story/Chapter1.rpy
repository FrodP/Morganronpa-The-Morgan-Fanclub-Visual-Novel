    mono "Ay yo, pog? Jump in the chat,
Where Discord vibes be where it's at.
From Morgan Fanclub to every single group,
The catchphrase I bring, it's just the truth."
    mono "Ay yo, pog? It's the call we make,
Spreading fun and laughter, no mistake.
In the rhythm of chaos and memes,
Let's embrace the hype, fill our dreams."
    mono "Ay yo, pog? Let's keep the energy high,
With every message we type, oh my!
In this song of Discord, we unite,
Ay yo, pog? It's our anthem, right!"
